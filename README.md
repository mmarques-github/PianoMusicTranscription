# Piano Music Transcription Project

## Objectives

Currently (15/05/2024) this project has the following ***tentative*** objectives:

- Train a neural network capable of transcribing piano audio to musical notes.
- Implement this neural network on an FPGA/Zynq device. (This may include the use of i2s microphone and respective implementation of the audio processing pipeline)
- Design a "Sing-star" like interface where the user can play the piano and the system will score the user's performance.
